## Understanding Key Safety Features

<Accordion label="What is Boil-Dry Protection?" group="safety" expanded="true">
Boil-dry protection is a critical safety feature that automatically shuts off the kettle if it detects no water inside. This prevents the heating element from overheating, which could cause damage or create a fire hazard. All our recommended kettles include this essential feature.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Why Choose Double-Wall Construction?" group="safety">
Double-wall kettles feature two layers of material with an air gap between them. This insulation keeps the exterior cool enough to touch safely while maintaining water temperature longer. It's especially important for households with children or elderly users who might accidentally touch the kettle.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="What Does Auto Shut-Off Really Do?" group="safety">
Auto shut-off technology uses thermostats to detect when water reaches boiling point (212°F/100°C). The kettle automatically powers down within seconds, preventing over-boiling, energy waste, and potential safety hazards. Premium models like those with STRIX thermostats offer more precise control.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Are Plastic-Free Kettles Safer?" group="safety">
Yes, kettles with no plastic contact with water eliminate concerns about BPA and other chemicals leaching into your drinking water, especially at high temperatures. Stainless steel and glass options provide the safest material choices for health-conscious consumers.
</Accordion>

## Essential Safety Tips for Electric Kettle Use

<Notice type="info" title="Daily Safety Practices">
Following proper usage guidelines maximizes your kettle's safety features and extends its lifespan significantly.
</Notice>

### Best Practices for Safe Operation

1. **Fill Within Limits**: Always fill between minimum and maximum markings. Overfilling can cause boiling water to spill, while underfilling may trigger boil-dry protection unnecessarily.

2. **Keep Base Dry**: Never immerse the base or kettle in water. Wipe spills immediately to prevent electrical hazards.

3. **Position Safely**: Place your kettle on a stable, flat surface away from counter edges where it could be knocked over.

4. **Regular Descaling**: Mineral buildup can interfere with thermostats and safety features. Learn [how to descale an electric kettle](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/how-descale-an-electric-kettle/) properly.

5. **Supervise First Uses**: When using a new kettle, monitor its first few boiling cycles to familiarize yourself with its sounds, lights, and automatic shut-off timing.
