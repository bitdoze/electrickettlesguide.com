## Can You Bring an Electric Kettle in Your Hand Luggage?

The short answer is: Yes, in most cases, you can bring an electric kettle in your hand luggage. However, there are some important considerations:

1. **Size and Weight Restrictions**: The kettle must fit within your airline's size and weight limits for hand luggage. Most airlines allow a main carry-on bag and a personal item, but size limits vary.

2. **Security Checks**: Be prepared for additional screening, as electrical items often require closer inspection. You may need to remove the kettle from your bag and place it in a separate bin for X-ray scanning.

3. **Airline Policies**: Some airlines may have specific rules about electrical appliances. Always check your airline's website or contact their customer service for the most up-to-date information.

4. **Cord Management**: Ensure the kettle's cord is neatly wrapped to avoid tangling with other items during security checks.

5. **Voltage Compatibility**: If traveling internationally, check if your kettle is compatible with the voltage at your destination.
