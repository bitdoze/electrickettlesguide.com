## Essential Buying Guide for Small Electric Kettles

<Accordion label="What capacity should I choose?" group="buying-guide">
For solo travelers or single servings, 0.4-0.5L (15-17 oz) is perfect. For couples or multiple cups, opt for 0.6-0.8L (20-27 oz). Consider your typical use case and available storage space.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Do I need temperature control?" group="buying-guide">
Temperature control is essential for tea enthusiasts (different teas require different temps: 160-180°F for green, 200-212°F for black) and pour-over coffee aficionados. If you only boil water for instant items, standard boiling is sufficient.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="What about dual voltage for travel?" group="buying-guide">
If you travel internationally, dual voltage (120-230V) is crucial to avoid carrying heavy voltage converters. Check if your destinations use different voltages - Europe and Asia typically use 220-240V while North America uses 110-120V.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="How important is material quality?" group="buying-guide">
Very important. Choose 304 stainless steel interiors to avoid plastic taste and ensure durability. Avoid kettles where plastic contacts boiling water. For a comprehensive guide, see [what to check when buying an electric kettle](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/what-to-check-when-buying-an-electric-kettle/).
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="What safety features are must-haves?" group="buying-guide">
Auto shut-off and boil-dry protection are non-negotiable. Double wall insulation and cool-touch exteriors prevent burns. Non-slip bases prevent accidents on unstable surfaces.
</Accordion>

## Maintenance Tips for Your Small Electric Kettle

<Notice type="success" title="Proper Care Extends Kettle Life">
Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and longevity, especially important for travel kettles exposed to different water qualities.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="How should I store my travel kettle?" group="maintenance">

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Can I use my small kettle for anything besides water?" group="maintenance">
Stick to water only. Other liquids (milk, soup, etc.) can damage the heating element and void warranties. For creative uses with water, check out [cooking with just a kettle](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/how-to-cook-with-just-a-kettle/).
