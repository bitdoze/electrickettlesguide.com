## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion label="What's the difference between countertop and personal blenders?" group="faq">
Countertop blenders feature larger motors (1000-1500 watts) and bigger pitchers (50-72 oz) designed for making multiple servings at once. Personal blenders are more compact with smaller cups for single servings. For families or meal prep, countertop models are more versatile.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Can these blenders make hot soup?" group="faq">
Most high-powered countertop blenders can heat soup through friction from the blades spinning at high speed. However, models with dedicated hot soup programs provide better temperature control. Always check your blender's manual before attempting to blend hot liquids.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="How important is motor wattage?" group="faq">
Motor wattage directly impacts blending power and efficiency. For smoothies with frozen fruit and ice, aim for at least 1000 watts. Less powerful motors (under 700 watts) may struggle with tough ingredients and wear out faster with regular use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Are glass or plastic jars better?" group="faq">
Both have advantages. Glass jars are more durable, scratch-resistant, and don't retain odors, but they're heavier. BPA-free plastic (Tritan) jars are lighter and won't shatter if dropped. Read our guide on [glass or plastic blender jars](/glass-or-plastic-blender-jar/) for a detailed comparison.
