## Performance and Efficiency

When it comes to performance, both ceramic and stainless steel kettles have their strengths. Stainless steel kettles generally heat water more quickly due to their superior heat conductivity. This makes them ideal for those who value speed and efficiency in their daily routine.

Ceramic kettles, while slightly slower to heat, excel in heat retention. Once the water is hot, a ceramic kettle will keep it at temperature for longer, making it perfect for those who enjoy leisurely tea sessions or who may not immediately use all the hot water.

In terms of energy efficiency, the difference is minimal when it comes to initial heating. However, ceramic kettles may have a slight edge for those who frequently reheat water, as their better insulation reduces the need for reheating.
