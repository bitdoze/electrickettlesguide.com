## Why Choose a Variable Temperature Kettle?

Different beverages require specific temperatures for optimal flavor extraction and enjoyment. A variable temperature kettle allows you to achieve these precise temperatures easily:

- Green and white tea: 70-80°C (158-176°F)
- Oolong tea: 80-90°C (176-194°F)
- Black tea: 90-100°C (194-212°F)
- Herbal teas: 100°C (212°F)
- Coffee: 91-96°C (195-205°F)

By using the correct temperature, you can avoid bitter over-extracted tea or weak, under-extracted coffee. This precision is particularly crucial for delicate green teas and specialty coffees, where even a few degrees can make a significant difference in taste.
