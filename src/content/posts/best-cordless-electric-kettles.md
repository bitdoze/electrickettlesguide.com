## Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings

Cordless electric kettles are generally more energy-efficient than traditional stovetop kettles or microwave heating. Here's why:

4. **Insulation**: Many models have good insulation, helping to keep water hot for longer without reheating.

To maximize energy efficiency:

- Only boil the amount of water you need
- Descale your kettle regularly to maintain heating efficiency
- Use the appropriate temperature setting for your beverage
