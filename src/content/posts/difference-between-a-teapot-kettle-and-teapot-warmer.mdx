**Sustainable Practices:**
<ListCheck>
- Boil only water you'll use (measure with teapot first)
- Use teapot warmer to maintain temperature vs. re-boiling
- Choose loose leaf tea over individually wrapped bags
- Compost used tea leaves as garden fertilizer
- Invest in quality tools that last decades vs. disposable options
</ListCheck>

**Carbon Footprint Comparison (per year, 2 cups daily):**
- Multiple daily re-boils: ~50 kg CO2

## Common Questions About Tea Tools (2025)

<Accordion label="Can teapots be used to boil water?" group="tea-faq">
No, teapots are designed only for steeping and serving. Boiling water in a teapot can crack ceramic/glass models and isn't effective. Always use a kettle for boiling, then pour into teapot for steeping.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Are electric kettles more efficient in 2025?" group="tea-faq">
Yes, dramatically. Modern electric kettles reach 80-90% efficiency vs. 70% for stovetop. [Energy efficiency guide](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/are-electric-kettles-energy-efficient/) shows electric kettles use 20-30% less energy and boil 2-3x faster.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="What's the best material for each tool?" group="tea-faq">
**Teapots**: Ceramic/porcelain for delicate teas, cast iron for black tea
**Kettles**: [Stainless steel for durability](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/ceramic-vs-stainless-steel-electric-kettles/), ceramic for purity, glass for aesthetics
**Warmers**: Metal construction for longevity, glass warming surface for visibility
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="How long do teapot warmers keep tea hot?" group="tea-faq">
**Candle warmers**: 2-3 hours with proper flame
**Electric warmers**: 4-8 hours with consistent temperature
**Smart warmers**: Indefinite with temperature monitoring (auto shut-off after 8-12 hours for safety)
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Do I need all three tools?" group="tea-faq">
Not necessarily. Minimum setup: kettle + teapot. Add warmer if you:
- Drink tea slowly over hours
- Serve multiple people at different times
- Want to maintain precise temperature
- Enjoy extended tea sessions

Many [tea maker sets](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/best-tea-maker-electric-kettle-set/) combine kettle + teapot functionality in one appliance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Can I leave my smart kettle plugged in?" group="tea-faq">
Modern [smart kettles](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/best-smart-kettles/) use minimal standby power (1-3W) and are designed for constant connection (needed for app control and scheduling). However, unplugging when traveling saves energy and protects against power surges.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Which tool matters most for tea quality?" group="tea-faq">
The **kettle** is most critical—water temperature dramatically affects tea flavor. [Variable temperature kettles](https://www.electrickettlesguide.com/best-variable-temperature-kettles/) with precise control (160-212°F) make the biggest quality difference. Teapot material is secondary but affects heat retention.
</Accordion>
