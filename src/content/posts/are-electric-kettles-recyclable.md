- Requires manufacturers to meet collection targets (65% of average weight of devices sold in the past two years)
- Aims to phase out hazardous materials in favor of safer alternatives
- Makes it easier for consumers to recycle electrical products

The WEEE Directive operates on the principle of extended producer responsibility, which means that manufacturers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of their products, including disposal and recycling. This approach encourages companies to design products with recycling in mind and to establish systems for collecting and processing e-waste.

Under the WEEE Directive, consumers can return their old electric kettles and other small electrical appliances to retailers when purchasing new ones, regardless of where the original item was bought. This take-back system makes it more convenient for consumers to recycle their old devices.

The directive has had a significant impact since its implementation:

- Increased recycling rates for electronic waste across Europe
- Improved design of electrical products to facilitate easier recycling
- Greater awareness among consumers about the importance of e-waste recycling

While the WEEE Directive is specific to the European Union, its principles have influenced e-waste policies worldwide. Many countries have implemented similar regulations, recognizing the global nature of the e-waste problem.

For consumers, understanding the WEEE Directive and similar regulations can help inform purchasing decisions. Look for products from manufacturers who are committed to sustainable practices and offer clear recycling instructions or take-back programs for their products.
